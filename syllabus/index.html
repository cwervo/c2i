      <h2 id="description">Course Description</h2>

      <section>
        This course exposes students to thorough and elaborate interactive
        concepts and techniques for applications. It is an extensive
        investigation in the interface, the mechanism, the controls, and the
        aims of interactive works. Students will learn how to design and develop
        complex interactive projects and understand how to undertake
        comprehensive research and direct their thinking process from
        brainstorming to the final outcome. They will be given the tools to
        conceive, plan and develop an interactive system and they will become
        aware of the importance of design’s role in contemporary media.
      </section>

      <h2 id="description">Learning Outcomes</h2>

        <section>
          <h3>Unit 1: Structure & Style</h3>
          <p>
            The first unit will focus on the fundamental relationship between
            structure (the semantic organization of content within and across
            documents) and style (the visual composition and presentation of
            content) as an organizing principle in design and on the web. We
            will examine how users navigate and orient themselves across chunks
            of content in a non-linear fashion. We will also examine how
            typographic concepts are expressed digitally and are responsive to
            the fluid and dynamic properties of the screen.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will also learn the basics of using Figma as a prototyping tool
            to express these ideas of structure and style with a focus on its
            typographic capabilities.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h3>Unit 2: Input & Output</h3>
          <p>
            Building on Unit 1, we will focus on the parts of an interface and
            how it responds to different valid, invalid, and edge conditions
            caused by user behaviors and interactions. Here, we will examine how
            users navigate and orient themselves within a process (as opposed to
            content) that is dynamic and changing and learn about basic user
            testing. We will also build upon our understanding of fluid and
            responsive typography to examine how this extends to compositional
            elements and form making on the web and the screen.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will also continue to explore how to express compositional ideas
            through Figma with a focus on reusable and dynamic elements like
            symbols, components, and layout properties as well as utilizing the
            tool’s basic prototyping capabilities.

        <section>
          <h3>Unit 3: Platforms & Community</h3>
          <p>
            In the final unit, we will consider what occurs when the content of
            an online experience, its interface, and its users are dynamic and
            in a state of constant change. This final unit requires students to
            build upon the lessons from the previous two units to design a
            platform for a community audience and to create a system that can
            flex and accommodate unpredictable conditions.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will also explore some of Figma’s more advanced capabilities like
            variables and plugins that allow for more advanced ways to prototype
            and test our design ideas.

      <h2>Assessable Tasks</h2>
      <section>
        <h3>Projects, Activities, and Readings</h3>
        <p>
          Every unit will consist of lectures, assigned readings, and projects.
          Topics will cover historical, critical, and practical issues in
          interaction design. Students are expected to contribute to a culture
          of critique and dialogue by active participation and engagement in
          every class.
        </p>

        <h3>Lectures</h3>
        <p>
          On Fridays, all students will attend a Core 2 Interaction Lecture.
          Each lecture will frame the concepts discussed in studio from the
          perspective of coding which will enable students to complete the
          projects assigned in studio. Attendance is required and necessary for
          completion of this course.
        </p>
        <h3>CD Lectures</h3>
        <p>All sophomores are required to attend the CD Lecture series.</p>
